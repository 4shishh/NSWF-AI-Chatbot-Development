# NSFW AI Chatbot Development ü§ñüîû

This repository contains the foundational code and architectural guidance for developing an advanced AI-powered NSFW chatbot designed for adult-oriented conversational experiences. It focuses on ethical, secure, and customizable development for age-restricted environments.

We have already developed a cutting-edge NSFW AI Chatbot that delivers an ultra-realistic conversational experience tailored for adult users. The live demo is available via **TripleMinds.co**, showcasing the chatbot's natural language depth and emotional responsiveness. Built using advanced AI and ML models, the system integrates React for a sleek frontend along with secure, scalable backend infrastructure. It includes mood-based dialogue, context retention, and customizable personalities. This repository provides the foundational tools and architecture to replicate or extend such a solution responsibly.

## NSFW AI Chatbot ‚Äì API Example (Node.js + Express)


```
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const { generateReply } = require('./aiEngine');

const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

// POST /chat - Get AI Response
app.post('/chat', async (req, res) => {
  const { userId, message, mood = "flirty" } = req.body;

  if (!message) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Message is required' });
  }

  try {
    const response = await generateReply(userId, message, mood);
    res.json({ reply: response });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'AI Chatbot failed to respond' });
  }
});

app.listen(5000, () => console.log('NSFW Chatbot API running on port 5000'));

```
```
## NSFW  Chatbot AI Engine Logic (aiEngine.js)


const { OpenAI } = require('openai'); // Or use local LLM like Ollama

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

async function generateReply(userId, message, mood) {
  const prompt = `You are an NSFW chatbot in a "${mood}" mood. Respond realistically to: "${message}"`;

  const chat = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
    model: "gpt-4", // Or gpt-3.5-turbo, or your preferred model
    temperature: 0.9,
    max_tokens: 150
  });

  return chat.choices[0].message.content.trim();
}

module.exports = { generateReply };

```
##  Sample Request Payload
```
POST /chat
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": "user_12345",
  "message": "Hey, what are you wearing?",
  "mood": "playful"
}

```
## Sample Response
```
{
  "reply": "Mmm, I'm wearing just your attention... Want to know more?"
}

```
